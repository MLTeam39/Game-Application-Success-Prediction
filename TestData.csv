Welcome to the world of WORP. Your iPhone now becomes a gaming machine, full of challenge and excitement. Manipulate the colored bits correctly and you take the win. Click \u201c\u2026More\u201d to learn why you should download this App today!\n\n\nTop #8 Game for iPhone 4G (ezinearticles.com)\n\nThe ultimate mind exercise and amusement comes up in a single iPhone application \u2013 WORP (techpeck.com)\n\n\nA profitable gift of concentration for all that love challenge (Carsten Scheibe \u2013 allemeineapps.de)\n\nI hate Solitaire, but this game is really fun to play (bitsundso.de)\n\n\nThis is really fun\n\u201cThe current version runs without problems, the menu is easy to use and totally understandable. The rules are very well explained and the tutorial is short and easy to understand. The game offers both diverting relaxation for small pauses or for bridging a gap between appointments and real challenges for combination skills in the higher levels. Conclusion: real fun!\u201d\n\u2013 obstfreund\n\nGreat little Brain Burner\n\u201eIf you enjoy a good puzzler, WORP is for you. I think the instructions could be a bit clearer, but a game or two will make things click. Very groovy ambient techno soundtrack. Well worth the dough they are asking for it.\u201c\n\u2013 Ortho123\n\nYour brow is furrowed in concentration. So far, you\u2019ve only managed to turn some of the primary bits into combined bits. That\u2019s what they call the playing pieces in this game \u2013 bits. Yet you have already eliminated quite a few from the board , but you still have a ways to go to get down to just one bit and release the game\u2019s next memory.\n\nThis is more than a mere brain teaser, WORP requires you to really stretch your intellect. The funny thing is, you love every second of it.\n\nJust imagine training your brain and relaxing at the same time. The WORP app challenges you to intuitively learn the code for subtractive color synthesis while enjoying the electronic sounds of Konsorten\u2122. Don\u2019t let the fancy talk scare you off. You can definitely do this and have a ton of fun while you\u2019re at it.\n\nThe idea is to eliminate bits. You start the first game with primary bits. Select one and all possible moves are revealed to you. Okay, start jumping the neighboring bits until there is only one left. There are instances when combined bits will occur and that just adds a new, interesting dimension to the game. But pay attention that the bits don't get stuck.\n\nWhen you get down to one bit, WORP starts calculating and opens another memory for you to continue on with. Check out the screen shots to see what further challenges WORP has to offer.\n\nMade a mistake? Don\u2019t worry, just click the Undo button and try again. You might have to do that more than once. This application has three difficulty levels and nine different memories, which increase in difficulty as they go.\n\nIf you need to take a little break because your brain is overheating, WORP lets you save your game and come back to where you left off.\n\nWORP provides the atmospheric sounds that complete the experience for you. You are going to be totally immersed in this game.\n\nFeatures\n- 9 different memories of increasing difficulty\n- 3 difficulty levels \u2013 beginner, intermediate and advanced \u2013 for each of the 9 memories\n- Atmospheric sound design by Konsorten\u2122\n- Interrupt any time via the Home button \u2013 resume where you left off\n- Undo all moves even after resuming a game\n- Game center integration (Leaderboards + Achievements)\n\nShow yourself what you and your brain can do. Download WORP now and start exercising your grey matter. Within minutes, you\u2019ll be fully absorbed and having the time of your life.""",Maximilian Auer,4+,"EN, DE",20501504,Games,"Games, Board, Entertainment, Strategy",7/6/2009,24/10/2016,Intermediate,3.0

In this captivating, dark Gothic puzzle-adventure, use Dr. Helsing's powerful torch and tonics to save the world from the demonic uprising!\n\nAWARDS AND ACCOLADES\nThis is no ordinary game! Helsing's Fire is recognized around the world as one of the App Store's premier puzzle games; full of charm and challenge.\n\n\u25a0 IGF 2011 - Best Mobile Game Finalist\n\u25a0 IGF 2011 - Excellence in Design Honorable Mention\n\u25a0 IGF 2011 - Excellence in Visual Art Honorable Mention\n\u25a0 SlideToPlay - The 50 Best iPhone Games of 2010 (#7)\n\u25a0 TouchArcade - Best iPod Touch and iPhone Games (Puzzle)\n\u25a0 AppAdvice - The Very Best iPhone Games of 2010 (Puzzle)\n\u25a0 TheAppera - Best iPhone Games 2010\n\u25a0 TouchGen - Editor's Choice Awards (Puzzle Runner-up)\n\nPRESS QUOTES\n\nSlideToPlay\n... Helsing's Fire is one of those puzzle games that does something completely original and is unbelievably entertaining.\n\nEurogamer\n... With its insidious wit and gothic charm, Helsing's Fire is a joyously original instant classic that iPhone owners should buy immediately.\n\nTouchArcade\n... It's one of the most unique games I've ever played and is a true App Store gem. Surely only a creature of darkness would let this one slip by them.\n\nTheAppera\n... Helsing's Fire reinvents the puzzle yet again with some light and dark dynamics I guarantee you have NOT seen yet. Prepare to be enthralled!\n\nGamePro\n... This is a game that would absolutely only work on the iOS platform, and it's hands-down one of the best games on the App Store. It gets my highest recommendation.\n\nADDICTIVE PUZZLES\nHelsing's Fire features a brand-new puzzle mechanic never before seen: use the touch-screen to position Helsing's torch to illuminate different combinations of monsters, then destroy them in the correct order using Raffton's supply of different tonics. The quick, rewarding puzzles make it a perfect game for brief play-sessions, but you'll always want to play 'just one more level'!\n\nA HUGE, DARK UNIVERSE\nWith puzzles set across four worlds, with 30 different levels in each world, all featuring fifteen different monster types including four bosses, Helsing's Fire provides an incredibly\nrich, deep, and varied game experience. And because on replays puzzles are re-generated randomly, the game will always be fresh!\n\nCOMPELLING SETTING\nThe Victorian theme, Gothic setting, and engaging characters make Helsing's Fire one of the most appealing story-oriented puzzle games released. Add to that the distinct minimalist style of the character portraits, the incredible dynamic lighting of the shadows cast by your moving torch, and an original soundtrack, and it's clear that Helsing's Fire presents an epic experience. Designed just for the iPhone, this is high-quality mobile gaming at its finest.\n\nMULTIPLE MODES AND ACHIEVEMENTS\nAs if the 120 distinct levels weren't enough, Helsing's Fire also comes with additional Endless Survival and Online Bounty modes, for the bravest of the brave! And when you've stood against the horde as long as you can, you can post your scores on the fully-integrated Crystal leaderboards, earning achievements for your accomplishments and claiming bragging rights from your friends.\n\nDracula must be stopped.

With each human kill of enemy warriors, you gain soul points which can be used to research for new spells or repair your tower.\n\nTo send your enemies to their deaths, touch the skull tower and drag a line towards the enemies to send a lightning towards them so that they will be electrified before they reach the skull tower.\n\nYour mana bar will increase similarly like your soul points when the number of enemies you killed increases. However,if more enemies hit on the skull tower, the health bar of the tower will decrease to a point it will be destroyed to ground. Your mission is to prevent that from happening!\n\nAfter you killed all the enemies on the level, you are given a resting time where you can either upgrade your existing spells or research new spells. You can also exchange all your soul points to repair your skull tower. \n\n\nSpells to research or upgrade:\n\n- Mana capacity - this is the ability to cast your spells. If you run out of mana, you cannot cast any more spells and your tower will be in danger. \n\n- Chain lightning damage - you can increase your damage of this spell to greater heights.\n\n- Hellfire - a fire from the hell that will burn your enemies to ashes. It works by drawing a circle over the affected area on the screen. The hellfire will ignite and set enemies within the chosen area on fire.\n\n- Frozen Touch - this spell will freeze your enemies and you can increase the duration for which they are frozen to delay time.\n\nIt works by double tapping the enemies to freeze them. After being frozen, the enemies cannot move or attack the skull tower.\n\nAddition character to summon:\n\n- Skeleton Archer - He will attack enemies automatically without you touching the screen. You can increase his level in the game to make him stronger by redeeming your soul points to upgrade his level.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Lightning, Fire and Ice 3 different school of spells\n- fully support touchscreen control\n- easy and simple gameplay\n- 3 different difficulty to choose from\n- brilliant spell effects and sounds.\n- In App Access to iPod Library\n\nFor technical support or any inquiries about the game, please email iphone-support@cdegame.com\n\n================\nSupport and Feedback\n\nOur iPhone/iPod Touch Forum is now live, please visit our web site and provide your comments and feedback so that we can improve.\n\n================",Nerv Technology,9+,EN,9205022,Games,"Games, Strategy, Action, Entertainment",30/07/2009,26/07/2010,Intermediate,3.5

You\'ll have many countless hours of fun and entertainment.\n\nThe game is very simple:\n- Mine dogecoins by clicking/tapping on a huge doge coin\n- The more dogecoins you mine, the more equipment you\'ll be able to purchase from the shop! Use your dogecoins to buy machines and diggers that will mine dogecoins even faster for you!\n- Unlock a secret machine and other high-level upgrades!\n- Fly to the moon on a spaceship, where you get brand new investments and upgrades to buy!\n\nYou\'ll go from swinging a wooden pickaxe for single coins to using time portals and flying through space on donuts and drilling into the moon to earn millions of coins per second! Watch the coins pile up right before your eyes!\n\nDon\'t be fooled by the simplicity of it. It\'ll look silly at first, but before you know it you\'ll be spending hours trying to land nuclear blasts and traveling through wormholes in space.\n\nDoge Miner is unique because you\'ll be playing for an infinite amount of time. There is no end to the game, so you can keep playing to your hearts content, or until you mine so many dogecoins that your device isn\'t able to count such a high number anymore!\n\nSince Doge Miner doesn\'t require 100% of your attention, you can keep mining dogecoins while you do other things, like convince your friends to download this game! :)\n\nCan you be the first to a million? a billion? a TRILLION? Find out. Don\'t let your friends beat you. They\'ve already started.\n\nBecome the Doge Master.\n\nBE AWARE - The dogecoins in this app are FAKE, and therefore cannot be redeemed, spent, or used in the real world. There are no connections to the real virtual currency, Doge Coin. This game does not, and never will, have the ability to generate, or ""mine"", real virtual currency.

Allied and Soviet Tank Aces advance on Berlin; German Aces advance on London and Moscow. At least that\'s what the orders from HQ say. But since you face overwhelming odds and are forced to scavenge supplies as you go, you might just find yourself retreating instead.\n\nThe goal of each round of play is to clear the enemy from a map sector and drive them off the far bank of a river so that your side can cross and advance. Skills you will need to accomplish this are a working trigger finger, the ability to navigate west or east, and driving ability sufficient to crash into other vehicles.\n\nA status panel shows the number of enemies left, rounds remaining, fuel, and armor strength. The last three can be replenished by ramming (not shooting) an enemy truck.

An IQ level indicates how one is positioned compared to the majority of individuals in a given age bracket.\n\nThe application ""IQ Test: Calculate your IQ"" includes:\n\n*A free test of 10 questions :\nThis 10-question IQ test is based exclusively on logic. It will allow you to evaluate your capacity for reasoning, determine the range of your overall intelligence, and give you a fast estimation of your IQ level.\n\n*Two 50-question IQ tests : (paid)\nThe tests we offer were carefully prepared to evaluate the intelligence level of individuals. Psychologists supervised them preparation.\nYou will be able to calculate your IQ, compare your performance to the rest of the population and receive a detailed analysis of your intelligence.\nThis report gives a detailed assessment of your strengths and weaknesses in the four identified dimensions (verbal, logical, mathematical and spatial intelligence).\n\n*A 50-question IQ test for children aged between 8 and 14 years old. : (paid)\nThe test we offer had been carefully prepared by a psychologist for children aged between 8 and 14 years old. \nIt will allow you to evaluate your intelligence level in four key areas, namely: logic, arithmetic, vocabulary and comprehension.\nThis test was developed especially for children between the ages of 8 and 14 under the supervision of an English-speaking child psychologist. \nIt includes questions that correspond precisely to each age group concerned (8-9 years-old, 10-11 years-old, 12-13 years-old and 14 years-old), and, therefore, in order to obtain an accurate evaluation, it is important to declare the child\'s actual age right at the start of the test. \n\n*The IQ Expert challenge : (paid)\nThis test is intended for high IQ individuals (above 110) \nThe ""expert"" version of the standard IQ test was developed to enable respondents whose IQs are above average (normative IQ score is approximately 104) to take this new and somewhat challenging assessment without answering the same questions usually encountered in IQ tests. \nThis IQ Expert test challenges respondents because it includes questions slightly more difficult than those found in the more traditional IQ tests. \n\nHow to take this test:\n1. You have exactly 35 minutes to answer the 50 questions that follow. A countdown will begin as soon as you start the test and begins again each time the contents of the succeeding page are fully displayed.\n2. You cannot use a calculator, but pen and paper are permitted.\n3. Answer all questions and, if you are not able to, guess the answer. Intuitive responses are taken into account in the general evaluation.\n4. If a question seems to suggest more than a single answer among the given choices, select the one that appears most obvious or more ""reasonable"" to you.\n5. If a youngster of less than 15 years of age wants to take part in an IQ test, we strongly suggest that he/she takes the test for children rather than the regular IQ test. \nIt has been carefully prepared by a psychologist for children aged between 8 and 14 years old.\n\nWhat our users say:\n\nHi, thanx. I really had no problem taking the test. I\'m very satisfied with the results. I\'m really happy that I came off so intelligently! \nI feel truly confident and I had fun with it besides.

The pieces and their moves will be familiar to anyone that has played standard chess, which makes this an ideal game for players of all skill levels. Certain spaces on the board allow pieces to make special moves, some of which are simply mind-blowing. Special visual effects and sounds enhance play. You can play locally with friends or challenge yourself against 3 levels of artificial intelligence. You can play alone or in teams of 2 vs. 2.\n \nIf you like chess or chess variants, you can hardly afford to miss out on Warlord Chess.\n \nBut I don\u2019t know 4 good chess players...\nDon\u2019t worry! Using the unique tabletop interface, you can select games with 2, 3, or 4 players in them. You can add computer/AI players as needed.\n \nMost importantly, because of the nature of the game, people of mixed skill levels can enjoy playing together. You don\u2019t need to be a chess star to have fun with Warlord Chess. In a 4-player free-for-all, the best player does not necessarily win!\n \nThat is a crazy looking board...\nThat\u2019s true! It needed to be to fit 4 full armies. Plus, it allowed us to add special spaces that make for some incredible moves.\n \nThe Chaos Symbol: the symbol in the center of the board gives a special move to Pawns, Kings, and Knights. If one of those pieces begins its move from one of the spaces touched by the symbol \u2013 then they can begin their move *from* any one of those spaces. This helps the Pawn and King a bit\u2026but it works wonders for the Knight. Don\u2019t believe us? Just look at the screenshots below!\n \nThe Castle: each player begins with their army surrounding their castle. A castle is made up of three spaces known as The Throne, the Great Hall, and the Courtyard. These spaces enhance the way the Bishop, Rook, and Queen move. Beware the Queen in the Courtyard!\n \nBut I\u2019m Just Learning/No Good at Chess/Easily Confused...\nThen we have the *perfect* chess game for you. The interface was designed for everyone. Just touch a piece to see all the moves it can possibly make. Then tap the space you want it to move to. If you don\u2019t like it you can Cancel that move and try another. When you are sure of your move, you can press a button to Confirm it.\n \nIf you need practice, play a local game against a single opponent and set the AI to Easy. Increase the difficulty and number of players as you get better. You can even play team games and learn from your partner. There are so many options!\n \nWhat Have You Got For Us Experienced Players?\nWe\u2019ve got a lot. If you are *very* familiar with chess, then Warlord Chess will provide you with a brand new challenge. It is nearly impossible to control a board this big, especially against 3 players who are out to get you. So good luck with that. You can set the AI to \u201cHard\u201d in order to play against opponents that can see multiple moves ahead.\n \nWe\u2019ve also provided you with tools for analyzing your Warlord Chess games. You can save and load up to five games. With our Rewind, Forward, Start, and End buttons you can move through those games step-by-step so you can figure out why you lost, brainstorm some killer new moves, or relive past glories.\n \nWhat Else Have You Got?\nWe\u2019ve got a board that hovers and rotates over a roaring field of flame. We\u2019ve got special attacks for each of the four colors in the game. We\u2019ve got Secret Passages and a cool scoring system. And we\u2019ve got more on the way.

Remember what you have learnt about surviving a zombie disaster and guide your people in this post-apocalyptic adventure.\n\nThe world as we know it no longer exists; now it is time to create a new one. It won\u2019t be easy! The zombies are a true plague. They\u2019re not very smart, but they\u2019re everywhere, and they are legion.\n\nBuild your own shelter and make it safe. Find survivors and convince them to join you. Together you will be able to improve the shelter and create a new home. Those will be the first steps towards building a new civilization, a new zombie-free world for humans.\n\nBut the road to survival is filled with danger. There are no governments, no authorities: anarchy reigns over the world. Survival not only depends on staying away from the zombies, you must also defend your shelter from bandits and thieves. Other survivors have built shelters too, and they see you as a threat. In this post-apocalyptic world, every new settlement that is discovered is considered a threat and treated like a dangerous enemy. Trust is no longer the order of the day \u2013 it is an exception.\n\nDEFEAT THE PLAGUE\nLead your squad against the zombie hordes and defeat the undead. Attack their gathering points and collect resources to help your people. Victory in the war against the undead lies in your hands.\n\n\nFIGHT FOR SURVIVAL\nAttack other settlements to survive. Study their defenses, prepare your team, and develop the right strategy to get inside other shelters to steal their resources.\n\nDEFEND WHAT IS YOURS\nTrain your team to defend your base and configure a defensive system to protect it from the zombies. But do not underestimate survivors! Humans from other settlements will try to plunder your shelter.\n\nRECRUIT SURVIVORS\nFind isolated people, and together build a safe place to live, far from zombies and bandits. Assign them roles in the shelter and ask for their help while you leave to collect resources. Turn survivors into heroes in the war against zombies.\n\nNEGOTIATE WITH OTHER SETTLEMENTS\nEveryone is an enemy, but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way forever. Contact other refugees and create alliances with them. Building a new world is a tough proposition: you\u2019ll need to negotiate with other shelters to succeed.\n\nBUILD THE BEST SHELTER\nThe world has come to an end, but that doesn\u2019t mean survivors should live badly. Manage your shelter, improve it to make space for more survivors, add entertainment zones and farming areas. Grow crops, recycle materials, and establish a self-sufficient community.\n\nTAKE THE SURVIVORS INTO THE REAL WORLD\n\nUse the Augmented Reality feature to bring the survivors into the real world. See how they look in the street or in your home, and take a photo with them.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n- Build your shelter from scratch and defend it from zombies and other survivors\n- Attack other shelters to get more resources\n- Player Vs.

Rack the balls with a powerful break shot. Impress your friends your billiard playing skill! You don\u2019t have to buy an expensive pool table just to enjoy fun and addictive pool party with your friends. Just download our app and play for FREE! \n\nDo you love to play billiard? Have you ever dreamed of becoming a biliard or snooker master, playing bilyard on a pool live tour across the country? Maybe you even dream of participating in the World Pool Championship. To become a maestro, you must practice and play against tough opponents to sharpen your snooker skill. The problem is, like most people, you probably don\u2019t have access to a pool table 24/7.  However, you can still practice your skills by playing virtual 8ball pool on your iOS device. You can practice with your friends or random players who also enjoy playing snoker as much as you do. \n\nSome people like to play 9 ball pool and some people enjoy 8ball pool games. In Pool with Friends, the game you can play is the 8 ball pool version. The rule of the game is slightly different than the 9 ball version. For example, in the 8ball version, you may not put the opponent\u2019s balls into the pockets. By playing this game, you will be able to practice and learn about the rules of the game easily. \n\n=============================================================\nTOP FEATURES OF POOL WITH FRIENDS \u2013 EIGHT BALL POOL MULTIPLAYER: \n=============================================================\n\n#MULTIPLAYER BILLIARD GAME\n\nPlay with your friends offline or play with random players online.  You can also play against yourself to practice your shots.   \n\n#REALISTIC 3D SIMULATOR\n\nPool with Friends uses an advanced and realistic physic simulator. You will see how the balls move on the pool table when you hit the ball with different strength and direction. Enjoy playing as if you are pool billiards pro.   \n\n#BEAUTIFUL AND REALISTIC GRAPHIC\n\nWe handcrafted the game graphic to make it look realistic and sharp. The graphic will help you determine how to make the best and most accurate shot. \n\n#LEARN ABOUT THE RULES OF THE GAME WHILE PLAYING\n\nAfter your turn, we will check the table and inform you if you\u2019ve committed a foul. We will also inform you the name of the foul. For example Scratch is a foul when a player pockets the white ball. As the result, the opponent can choose where to place the white ball. This is a great way to memorize the rule of the 8 ball pool game. \n\n#SMOOTH GAMEPLAY AND GAME CONTROL\n\nTo play this game, first tap on the table to place the ball to rack. Then adjust the direction and the strength. Tap on the Hit button to hit the white ball. It\u2019s a very easy and straightforward gameplay, but it\u2019s not easy to master. You need to practice to understand the physic of the game and how the ball moves when you hit using certain level of strength to a certain direction.\n\nPlay pool (8 Ball) with your friends around the world.\nUsing turn based multiplayer, you can have multiple games going at the same time. Requires GameCenter and internet to play.\nFeaturing realistic physics, great graphics, standard rules, fun gameplay and highscores.\nWarning: Quitting the game after you hit the white ball and before your turn is over will result in a loss.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for?

If that\'s all you\'ve got, stick together and try to engage from a closer distance. \n\n- Smoke will obscure your position from the enemy- utilize Smoke to sneak into position. \n\n- Use Flashbangs to temporarily stun your enemies. Stack your squad up and flash bang your way into the bomb site. Be careful not to stun your own squad members! \n\n- In a long match, on some rounds you may want to save your money so you can purchase stronger weapons for the next round. \n\nGood luck, Commander!",orbosphere,12+,EN,1171739648,Games,"Games, Action, Strategy",15/11/2017,22/01/2019,High,4.5

Prepare to say goodbye to pen and paper simplicity, and say hello to TAC!  The rules are familiar, but with an imaginative twist!  This classic puzzle has been expanded and reimagined into a unique and epic variation on an all-ages favorite!\n\nYOU KNOW HOW TO PLAY\nBut you don\u2019t!  TAC is played on a huge 3x3 grid called the Big Board.  Each of the nine squares are actually tic-tac-toe games of their own.  The gameplay in each of these squares, called the Little Boards, is familiar.  Players take turns placing either X\u2019s or O\u2019s in an effort to attain three in a row.\n\nTHE TWIST\nEvery turn is a strategic dance.  Each placement you make on the Little Board determines which square your opponent gets to move to on the Big Board.  You can either gain advantage on the Little Board or force your opponent to play in a certain square.  Move wisely!\n\nSCORE\nThere are two ways to win!  \n1)  Score three in a row on the Big Board!  If you win on a little board, it\u2019s like selecting a square on the big board.  If you succeed in lining up a trio of wins on the big board, you win!  \n2)  Dominate the big board!  If you earn more squares on the big board than your opponent, you win!\n\nChallenge your Facebook buddies or square off against strangers.  Take on an AI opponent and perfect your strategy.

You as a warlord of Roman and need to protect, upgrade and create a war strategy to put a stand against the marching Greece enemies. Story revolves around one of the fantasy history about these titan quest, evolution and fight.\n\nThey have game like Olympic style games in Greece, while Gladiatorial games were played in Rome. Every citizens most enjoyable time is when these games are running like a festival season.\n\nCreate a Roman type strategy.\nDefend your Roman area and people from marching enemies.\nPlan to take a strong stand against attack from Air, Land and Water.\nUpgrade your war machinery regularly.\nPower from Gods like thunder to fight against titans and warlords.\nUse coins to purchase more weapons and upgrades.\n\nAncient civilization had unique culture, gods, war type, society, treating women, slaves and art styles.\n\nThe ancient Roman and Greek civilizations had well-organized political processes that greatly influenced the manner in which later governments were structured in Europe and the United States. The system of political parties, the establishment of divisions in government -- even political words such as democracy, monarchy and tyranny originated in ancient Rome and Greece. Although Rome drew many of its political principles from the Greeks, and as a result, developed a government similar to that of Greece, there were several differences between the two.\n\nGreeks built roads to connect two specific cities. Romans built roads that connected their empire to Rome. This is the location of this addictive game.\n\nSome of the popular Greek God Vs Roman Gods names\nZeus : Jupiter\nPoseidon : Neptune\nDionysus: Bacchus\nHades : Dis Pater, Pluto, Orcus\nAres : Mars\nHermes : Mercury\nEros : Cupid (Amor)\n\nBoth are Mediterranean countries, similar enough latitudinal for both to grow wine and olives, but with very different terrain. The ancient Greek city-states were separated from each other by hilly countryside and all were near the water. on the other hand Rome was inland, on one side of the Tiber River, but the Italic tribes (in the boot-shaped peninsula that is now Italy) did not have the natural hilly borders to keep them out.\n\nIn Ancient Greece women had no rights.  They were property. While in Rome, under the king and in the republic, women were not property, still they had no equal rights.  During the Empire, Roman women had quite a few rights, but were still not citizens.\n\nThe armies of Republican Rome were strongly rooted in the Italian peasantry.  Rome's political reach was broader than comparable Greek states and military service obligations extended farther down the social scale. This made for a large army with a lot of rural soldiers: people who were used to the outdoor life, familiar with manual labor, and self sufficient.\n\nGreek city state armies tended to be more upper class affairs: the extreme example being Sparta, where the entire army was drawn from the privileged class of Spartiates; but even at Athens there was a lot of tension between the relatively well off hoplite class of landowners and prosperous city folk and the thetes - the urban  working class who could not afford their own armor and were relegated to the rowing benches of the navy. (Note the the Macedonians during their heyday had a much broader base among rural peasants, more on the Roman model).\n\nOver time both Greek and Roman armies professionalized, but in different ways.  After the classical period many Greek armies relied heavily on mercenaries, which provided some impressive technical skills and specialties, but also political unreliability.  Roman armies became more professional as the Italian peasantry was displaced in the late Republic by huge slave-run plantations: the military revolutions of generals like Caesar and Pompey were made easier as soldiering became a lifelong career instead of a short-service civic duty.""",Wahid Zhowandai,4+,EN,94702592,Games,"Games, Strategy, Action",13/03/2016,21/05/2018,Intermediate,4.0

You may need to take a gamble or two to get a high score!\n\n---- Dash Mode ----\nFor those who like to turn up the pressure! Those pesky white boxes will speed up throughout the game to test your swipe skills to the limits.\n\n---- High 5 Mode  ---- \nThink classic mode is too easy?

You may play against the computer, or play with one to three other friends or network players via Game Center.  Seats that are not filled by friends or network players are played by the computer.  With the multiplayer game, you may exchange group text messages and voice chats while in the game. \n\nEach player is dealt 13 tiles in a hand. The players take turns to draw a tile and discard one. The goal is to make 4 sets and 1 pair. You can win by drawing a new tile or claiming a discarded tile that completes the hand of 14 tiles. Hands formed must be of some minimum  point value (0-3) in order to win the round. A zero base point would allow chicken hand. The default is 0 base point, but can be customized. \n\nIf the base point is set to greater than zero, an attempt to steal a discard that does not produce the minimum points to win will be preempted by another player\'s claim for pung, for example. Falsely declaring a win when the hand does not meet the base point will be penalized. The claim on a discard to form a hand with enough points to win has priority over other attempts to form kong, punt, or chow.\n\nRefer to wikipedia for a detailed description of the suite and scoring system of the game. \n\nAs few reviewers noted, this game offers realistic play. Drag the tile discarded by another player to your hand to claim it. Drag a tile out to discard it. If you draw a winning or kong tile, push multiple tiles forward to show your hand.    \nYou can move and rearrange the tiles at will.  To have them sorted automatically, do a hoizontal swipe above your hand.\n\nOn iPad, it supports layout on the larger screen in both portrait and landscape modes.\n\nA convenient feature, especially for single handheld play on the iPhone, is you can also click on the hand button to claim a tile or declare a win.\n\nYou can adjust the game speed and sound.  You can also control that hands be of some minimum  point value (0-3) in order to win the round. A zero base point would allow chicken hand.\n\nChoose  ""Align discarded tiles"" to line discarded tiles neatly, else discarded tiles are spinned and placed randomly.\n\nYou can choose to play flower and season tiles.\n\nYou can change the the color of the background and tiles, or use a picture as the game background. \n\nMultitask switching on supported iOS. Game is paused when you switch away from the App and automatically resumed when you return. Resume button is still used to resume game saved if App is terminated (or for older iOS without multitask support).\n\nThe players bank will be shown at the start of the game. To see the bank during the game, tap on the player\'s name.  \n\nYour name in the game is taken from the Game Center alias and can be customized in the Game Center app. If you did not login to Game Center, the name is determine from the following sources (if used) in order: your name used for iCloud, other email, the name on your iPad/iPhone/iTouch.\nYou may customize the names of the computer players.",POK,4+,"EN, ZH, ZH",8246272,Games,"Games, Strategy, Card",17/03/2010,16/05/2019,Intermediate,3.0

Keep it as simple as you like or be a tycoon and micromanage building your city and keeping your people happy; the choice is yours.\n\nDESIGN AND EVOLVE YOUR CITY\nDynamic land generation ensures no two civilizations will ever look the same.

Combine tiles of the same color to score points. After each swipe, the total value of the combined tiles is added to a cumulative total for swords, dragons, lives, and gold displayed at the top of the screen and a battle begins. In the battle, swords reduce the \u201cdragons\u201d score and dragons reduce the \u201clives\u201d score. The \u201cswords\u201d score decreases by the value used to attack the dragons. As dragons are slayed, the \u201cexperience\u201d bar rises, and when it reaches the top the player improves his/her level. The game ends when no lives remain or the arena is full and no more tiles can be moved.\n\nFeatures\n\n1. Combo:\n\u3000When three or more of the same tile are combined, the tiles disappear.\nCombine 3 tiles: 2 x points\nCombine 4 tiles: 4 x points\nCombine 5 tiles: 8 x points (only 5x5 mode)\n\n2. Items:\n\u3000The gold collected during play can be exchanged for items.\n\u3000However, each item can only be used once.\nE.g.\nRemove all dragon tiles from the arena\nMultiply the number of lives by two\n\n3. 2 Single Player Mode ( 4x4, 5x5 ):\n\n4. Two Player Mode:\nWhen a player swipes the screen, all of his/her tiles and all of his/her opponents tiles move in the direction swiped. Players can disturb their opponent\u2019s play by moving the opponent\u2019s tiles in the same direction as their own. When three or more sword tiles are combined, one dragon tile is sent over to the opponent\u2019s arena: this tactic can be used to alter the layout of the opponent\u2019s arena and disturb his/her play.\n\n5. vs.AI Mode:\nA player compete with AI(Computer).\nIf it's hard to recognize AI's tiles, you can rotate all AI's tiles in the pause menu.\n\n6. Game Center. \nGame Center leaderboards and achievements are supported.\n\n7.

Through an immersive environment of countless challenging levels, Shapes will test your skills to establish order into a fragmented reality. Are you ready to fight disorder?\n\nThis brainteaser game will challenge your logical skills, encouraging your creativity while you assemble the fragmented shards into a holistic image. This game mixes, in fact, your ability to use both sides of your brain: the creative hemisphere and the logical one. \n\nIn Shapes, you will experiment a relaxing and spatial environment, enjoying a soothing soundtrack and exciting puzzles. In this game we merge figures within classical traits and futuristic neon lights with the purpose to play with your senses, imagination and logic. Once all the pieces are connected, a sense of clarity will arise and you will build shapes that appeal to your eyes and mind. If you feel proud of your achievements, share the concluded levels with your friends or simply save them on your smartphone. Your mission is quite clear in Shapes: fight chaos and bring life to fragmented shards.\n\nThe game concept works almost like a metaphor of a stressful day or a troubled period. The empathy between music and the visual features will deliver you a relaxing and pleasurable sensation of order being restored. Like in traffic, subway rush hours or busy workdays, it will be you against chaos round after round, level after level\u2026 \n\nConsidered by players as one of the best efforts ever released by Infinity Games, Shapes is the perfect game for fans of beautiful brainteaser games. Accept our challenge and bring some order to this topsy-turvy world!\n\nHow to play Shapes?\nShapes is a very intuitive and easy game to play. In the first levels, you will instantly get the game\u2019s dynamic and soon you will feel completely submerged by this soothing and interstellar ambience. As the difficulty increases, you will feel more and more challenged to complete the enigma and achieve clairvoyance. To complete the level, you have to rotate the shards and build shapes. Once the neon lights are on, you won another battle and the level is completed.\n\nCan I save my game progress?\nThe game progress is instantly ally saved on your game app, so you can resume in the level where you stopped in the previous game session. This allows you to maintain your progress, always discovering new levels and different figures. \n\nDo I need to pay anything to play?\nLoop Energy is completely free and you don\u2019t need to pay for playing the game. However, you can remove the ads for the price of a coffee and enjoy a more fluid version of the game. Ads were an option we needed to take in order to assure the development of Shapes and future games.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach us via e-mail or on Facebook. \n\nDo you like our work?

He will then point his arm where you want to shoot. He will then fire a bullet that bounces and ricochets a lot. As long as you aim and plan your shot well, this has the potential to mow down your targets like ducks in a firing range. Individually, a target is worth 10 points. But if you manage to take down your targets in succession before the bullet stops ricocheting your score will increase, and increase dramatically. Take down one target then another and another and watch as your score increases significantly.\nIn this scenario, let\u2019s say you did hit 3 targets in a row. The  first target is worth 10 points, the second 20 points and the third 30 points. You can really rack up a high score very quickly this way. So it\u2019s really recommended that you line up your targets and take them out one by one. You\u2019re given 10 bullets per level to take down the targets.

In response to the resource crisis, the two most powerful corporations, BIOSPHERE and APEX, set off to lead a space expedition. To their amazement they discovered extensive resources on a strange planet far off of even the largest star maps. It contained precious exotic minerals whose energy levels were off the chart. This was earths answer. BIOSPHERE immediately started mining in anticipation of the prosperity and promise that the minerals could have for Earth. However, APEX saw the minerals as a highly lucrative business opportunity and promptly declared ownership of the planet and its vast resources. They ruthlessly engaged BIOSPHERE\u2019s forces intent on wiping them out. Only one corporation will make it back to Earth alive. The answer is up to you!\n \n=== Description ===\nMechCom is a new fast-paced stable 3D action RTS that is optimized for mobile devices. It\u2019s heavily influenced by the popular open-source RTS, Warzone 2100 and Dune. It takes place in the year 2100 when two corporations (BIOSPHERE and APEX) go at it deploying powerful mechs and heavy hardware from the mothership in a classic RTS environment in the hunt for resources. It uses fluid touch controls that are aimed for simplicity and ease of use. Classic old-school resource collection mechanics are favored as well as simple clear graphics. There are a number of customized mechs you can build as well as various structures. There are also a handful of upgrades that you can utilize which can mean the difference between victory and defeat against a clever and challenging AI. Finally there are a large number of maps (zones) to choose from for Custom Games or you can go with a Ranked Game where the computer matches you to your skill level depending on your rank and how many promotion points you have earned to keep you challenged.\n\n=== How To Play ===\nGameplay primarily consists of building individual units and structures on build pads. You build a refinery to harvest minerals and convert them to money. You then use the money to build a broad assortment of unit components, upgrades and an assortment of structures such as an Armory to unlock multiple component upgrades (also costing money) and a turret for example. Once you create your army, you can converge on the map to take control of Beacons where you can deploy more units. Capturing and keeping Beacons is vital in making your way across the map. Engage and eliminate all opponent units and structures to be declared the victor. \n\n=== Game Features ===\n\u2022  Basic Tutorial.\n\u2022  Challenging AI.\n\u2022  Simple 3D graphics.\n\u2022  7 Ranks to progress though.\n\u2022  Simple large touch controls.\n\u2022  12 maps set in 3 different landscapes.\n\u2022  NO ADS OR IN-APP PURCHASES EVER!\n\u2022  Old-school resources collection system.\n\u2022  2 game modes (Ranked Game and Custom Game).\n\u2022  16 unique combinations of mechs PLUS UPGRADES!\n\n=== Game Tips ===\n\u2022  Strongest is not always best.\n\u2022  Upgrades and key to victory.\n\u2022  Hover chassis can go over water and works great for scouts.\n\u2022  Speed is important.

PLAY NUMBERS NO ONE ELSE IS PLAYING\u203c Smarter Quick Pick is designed to find you those numbers. It eliminates common patterns people use\u2014such as dates\u2014giving you confidence you won\'t be sharing your prize!\n\nImagine - you wait your whole life for that big lottery jackpot. You finally win, and guess what? You have to share your prize with other winners! Can\'t be avoided, right? Actually, yes it can!\n\nThe first thing to understand when playing the lottery is that every ticket has the same chance of winning. Yes, even 1-2-3-4-5*6! I know this sounds crazy, but there was actually a lottery drawing in Germany that came up 2-3-4-5-6*26. And guess what happened? Over 38,000 people had to split that jackpot!\n\nThat\'s when it hit me: People have systems for picking lottery numbers, and if I can avoid those patterns, I can drastically increase my odds of not having to share the winnings!\n\nHave you ever wondered why so many lottery jackpots have multiple winners, while so many other drawings have no winners at all? You\'ve probably seen it many times: big jackpot, millions of players, and no one wins. Drawing after drawing, no winners. And the jackpot grows and grows. Then finally one drawing has 2...3...sometimes even 5 winners - all at once! Why is that??\n\nThe secret is in the drawings that had no winners. If you look at those numbers, you will see something amazing - no patterns! No dates, no anniversaries - nothing in particular that would have made someone want to use those numbers. These are the types of numbers you want to play!!\n\nWe have analyzed these patterns and designed ""Smarter Quick Pick"" specifically to avoid them. ""Smarter Quick Pick"" will give you numbers to play that have a low liklihood of being played by others. After all, why would you play numbers that other people are playing??\n\nYou may be wondering why you need this app when lotteries already have ""Quick Pick""... Well, you should never use a lottery\'s built-in ""Quick Pick""\u203c Here are two very good reasons why:\n\n\u25b6 Reason #1: You may actually be increasing your odds of having to share! Computers cannot generate random numbers on their own - they need a starting point (or \u201cseed\u201d) number \u2013 and most of them use the time of day. Quick Picks are generated on the spot by the local lottery terminal. These terminals operate independently, using the current date & time to help them decide what your ""random"" numbers will be. With potentially hundreds of other people buying tickets at that moment across the region, the chances of getting the same numbers as someone else go up.\n\n\u25b6 Reason #2: Quick Picks do not eliminate numbers and patterns people use often. You want to play random numbers, yes \u2013 but only to a point. You also want to eliminate sets of numbers and patterns that people commonly use. Standard ""Quick Pick"" does not do this for you. ""Smarter Quick Pick"" does!\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Works for all major lotteries around the world\u203c\n\u2022 Utilizes online atmospheric noise data to calculate random numbers\n\u2022 Will very likely never display the same numbers twice\u203c",Baby Toga Software,12+,"EN, DE, SE, ES",11223040,Games,"Games, Entertainment, Strategy, Casino",14/08/2013,14/08/2013,Intermediate,4.0

Seventy thousand French troops, constituting the bulk of Napoleon\u2019s Armee du Nord, which two days earlier had vanquished the Prussian Army of the Rhine at Ligney, now expected to exploit their initial victory by destroying the unsupported and inexperienced Anglo-Dutch forces which the Duke of Wellington had deployed across the Brussels-Charleroi highway a few miles south of the inconsequential hamlet called Waterloo.\n\nThat morning at his headquarters in Le Caillou, Napoleon discussed the impending battle with his subordinates while awaiting the arrival of several French Corps which had bivouacked further south. Disagreeing with the French generals whom Wellington had consistently defeated in Spain, Napoleon insisted that his opponent was a poor commander and that the English troops were much inferior to the French.

If you\'re not familiar with the rules of Mahjong Solitaire game, the this app is a good introduction, because this app is easy to play. The difficulty level of this app is for all levels, although most of the levels are for ""beginner"" to ""intermediate."" The easy levels (boards layout) are fairly simple, the stacks of tiles are short and the number of tiles to match are not overwhelming.\n\nThe rules of the game is simple:\n- You are presented with the game board, containing stacked tiles, forming structures such as the so-called ""pyramid"" or ""turtle"" solitaire board, tower-like stacks and others. \n- To win the game, all the tiles much be removed from the board by matching them.\n- Tiles can be matched if they have the same face/picture, under the condition that the tile is not blocked. \nA tile is not blocked if it can slide to the left, right, or both, and there\'s no tiles above it.\n- You lose the game when the board has not been cleared and there\'s no more tiles that can be moved.\n\nSounds simple? Then start playing. But prepare for some challenges, because Mahjong Solitaire is an easy to learn game that can be hard to master. You need to think ahead and chose which tiles to match carefully. Sometime the best move is the one that will free more matching tiles and not the most obvious ones. Sometime you\'ll just have to try your luck because the tile underneath the matching tile is blocked. \n\nAs mentioned, it can be challenging not to not end up with tile(s) that are not ""free,"" which cause the board to be in an unsolvable state (dead-end). This can occur when all the matching tiles are covered by other tiles or if they can\'t be moved because there\'s a tile blocking its sides or covering above it.\n\nFeatures:\n- Colorful Easter eggs themed variations of popular Solitaire Mahjong game. Instead of matching numbers and bamboos and dragons, you\'re matching pictures of painted Easter eggs.\n- Contains many boards for beginners and casual players alike.\n- The boards are for various Mahjongg skill levels, beginners to intermediate. The traditional/classic turtle/pyramid board tower is included. \n- Easy touch interface, just tap a tile then that another tile that matched it.\n- Hint option to highlight matching Mahjongg tiles (if there\'s a match possible).\n- Shuffle options to assist when reaching a dead end. This will ""free"" some of the previously blocked tiles. But use sparingly because the number of Shuffles is limited.\n- Cheerful graphics and soothing background music.\n- Every board (level) is generated with a special algorithm. No game is ever the same; and even though your moves may make a board unsolvable, every board starts with a solvable configuration.\n\nWorks on phone and tablets.

It draws on more than two and a half decades of experience, a massive knowledge base and the newest research, as well as modern Monte Carlo techniques to help you learn and grow as a player. This is, hands down, the strongest Go engine available for the iPhone or iPod Touch.\n\nIgowin Pro supports play on 9x9, 13x13, or 19x19 boards.   This flexible program lets you set your rank as you like.  Game parameters can be set up automatically based on your playing level, or you can choose whatever opponent strength or handicap you want.\n\nA built in \u201cmagnifying glass\u201d helps you put your move exactly where you want it.  Smart move technology snaps your stone into the correct position.  The convenient ""instant-undo"" feature lets you reset a mis-tap without waiting for the computer to finish thinking.\n\nGames can be saved, commented, and emailed as attachments for later study to help improve your play. \n \nIgowin Pro has the most comprehensive tutorial of any app of its kind. You can learn the game basics quickly and begin playing immediately.  You can ask for a hint or an estimate of the current score anytime during a game.  With no complex menus and just a few basic controls, the game is easy to navigate.\n\nAll AI levels are calibrated by actual play, on an online server. That means that the ranking Igowin gives you is very close to what your real-world ranking would be, rather than an arbitrary number that only applies within the app. \n \nIgowin Pro uses the traditional Kyu ranking system to measure your performance. The engine automatically adjusts its level of play to match yours. By using the calibrated rankings within the Go engine, it can play a 9x9 even game, with no handicaps, against any player, from beginner all the way up to 3 Dan level.  19x19 even games automatically adjust from beginner to 3 Kyu. \n \nWhether you\'re a rookie looking for a fun way to learn and play the game of Go, or a crafty veteran looking for a challenge, Igowin is the app you\'ve been searching for.

Each hero has up to four active skills, and with up to three passive skills, he can make more choices in battle.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Beautiful Character Modeling\n\n\n   Hundreds of mythical characters are not just card wars, they all have beautiful 3D personas modeling. From heroic Athena to clumsy and dull stone men, from sinister and cunning Rocky to majestic Audin. Not only character modeling, each character also has the skills to match their own background story, so that the player has more sense of immersion in the whole mythological world.\n\n\n\n\n4. Diverse Patterns and Scenarios\n\n\n   In addition to the standard plot mode, there are challenging tower mode, the arena mode to challenge other players, and the fun illusion maze mode. Each model has a similar core, but also different embellishments, so that players can maintain a different sense of freshness, without excessive learning costs.\n\n== CONTACT US ==\nEmail us at ios@ifreyr.com\n\n== DEVICE ==\nRecommend device\uff1aiPhone 5s and above / iPad 3 and above / iPad mini 2 and above / iPod Touch 6 and above\nSystem required: iOS 7.0 and above",Freyr Games,12+,EN,2425406464,Games,"Games, Action, Strategy",19/12/2018,19/12/2018,Intermediate,3.0

The points are accumulated in the form of hands. Hand is same as trick in Spades. After the cards are dealt, players make call (bid) in the range of 1-13 hands that they expect to capture based on their cards. Players with several high cards and high number of spades would make a higher call than a player with mostly low cards and less spades cards. The cards are ranked form highest to lowest in the usual way (Ace being the highest and 2 being the lowest). Spades, as said earlier is higher ranked suit. Players try to play trick on other players to make them loose their higher cards. After playing five rounds, a player is declared winner with the highest points.\nIn this version, you will play with three intelligent robot players devised to simulate real-time players.

In a high fantasy setting, the game will take players through an adventure where magic and sword collide and friendship and betrayal intertwine.\n\nPartia 2 : The Pretenders War is a sequel to Partia: The Broken Lineage. The game packs 22 stages that could present challenges to any SRPG fan.\n\nPartia 2 introduces many new features, including the choice of ""Common turn"" rule where all factions make moves alternatively (like Chess) instead of taking turns to move all his/her units. I believe this will bring a new nuance to gameplay if a player choose to do so. It can be toggled in intermission, and you can always play the game in the traditional FE way. (Common turn idea is from Berwick Saga) AI had improved a lot, and horse units now can move after attacking, if they have remaining move distances. \n\nRegrettably, the game could not deliver large animation battle. If you felt the game looked bad in Partia 1, then you\'ll find this game look much the same, except we have much bigger and nicer character portraits. It is because original Partia was never profitable, making Partia 2 production running on fume. (It sold around 6000 copies in two years) The stress of not getting paid almost broke our team of two, but somehow sheer will allowed this game to be out here for you. So whether this game series is success or not, I am immensely proud of the results. How many five year projects can a person do in a life time? ;-) Many times I was tempted to include some IAP stuff into the game and get cheap dollar or two, but I decided against it. More than anything, I rather have this game to be remembered as good, than have that IAP distaste.\n\nSo you may refrain from purchasing this game if you didn\'t like Partia 1. But I promise you it will be a much better experience (and much more challenging) if you did enjoy the original Partia.\n\nThank you all, and please let us know what you think!",Imago Software,9+,EN,79221760,Games,"Games, Strategy, Role Playing, Entertainment",22/10/2014,24/06/2018,High,4.5

All plays are movie names, and movies are connected by actors. You play a movie connected to mine, then I play one connected to yours. Opponents fire movies back and forth getting points for each play. It may take seven or more connected movies to reach 100 points and win the game.\n\nFireback Movies is simple to understand but challenging and entertaining. Traditional trivia games ask random lists of trivia questions. In Fireback Movies, each player dynamically creates the challenge posed to the opponent on each turn. For example, if your opponent plays Boogie Nights, you could fire back Almost Famous (connected by Philip Seymour Hoffman.) There are limitless possibilities of finding one degree connections between movies using any actor.\n\nFireback Movies is a casual game where players can take their turns when they want. Fireback Movies checks your connections by referencing its proprietary database of 250,000 movies. It knows when there is more than one connection even when you do not. When players take their turns, the app gives immediate feedback to support the option for rapid-fire play. The actors who connect movies are shown after each play.\n\nUnlike most trivia games, Fireback Movies lets you show your personality. In Fireback Movies, players play movies they are familiar with. As opponents reveal their movie knowledge, you learn about them. A game against one friend is a different experience from one against another.\n\nPlays in Fireback Movies are strategic. Some connected movies score more points than others. If you can play a movie with different actor connections from the last play, it is called a Change Connection and gets the most bonus points. Bonus points are also awarded for multiple actor connections and fast play.\n\nWhen players are stumped in Fireback Movies, they can use lifelines or pass. Lifelines are popular movies connected by popular actors that keep the game fun for both players. Fireback Movies is a freemium full-featured game with no limitations requiring purchases or advantages for people to ""pay to win.""\n\nOne Degree Games created Fireback Movies to give movie fans a new way to connect with each other by connecting movies!\n\nFollow us on: \ntwitter - https://twitter.com/firebackmovies\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/firebackmovies\npinterest - https://www.pinterest.com/firebackmovies",One Degree Games,4+,"AF, CA, HR, CS, DA, NL, EN, FI, FR, DE, EL, HU, ID, IT, JA, KO, LT, MS, NB, PL, PT, RO, RU, ZH, SK, ES, SV, TH, ZH, TR, UK, VI",45889536,Games,"Games, Trivia, Strategy",25/07/2014,12/2/2019,High,4.5

On a turn, players place a family member token on a location in town in order to collect resources or to take actions to improve their farm.

New actions become available at the start each round and resources get replenished on any taken in the previous round.\n\nAt harvest crops are reaped, newborn animals arrive and you must feed your family. Growing your family gives you more actions but means you have more mouths to feed!\n\nThe player with the most productive and advanced farm at the end of 14 rounds is the winner. Victory points are awarded for the number of fields and pastures you have, as well as for crops and animals.

Or so it seems at first, the gameplay is remarkably easy to get your fingers around (playing on a phone, that\'s an important feature). But what becomes addictive is not the simple play, but the depth of story that has been crafted.\n\n-Fun Stuff!! What an adventurous involving time I had playing Zombie Moon. Love the sounds and customizing my marine to do in the zombies. \n\nReview from one of the Game Creators\nAs one of the game creators, and player too, I love Zombie Moon and glad others are as well!  It\'s the mobile evolution of the existing www.starpirates.net, www.spybattle.com & www.gatesofcamelot.com.  It\'s actually in the same universe at, roughly, the same time.  The gameplay is streamlined as the mobile experience (and screensize!) leads to a different style of play.  For me, it works. \n\nI love the storyline that comes out through the Missions feature.  There is a mystery involved, and that unrolls through the Missions.  \n\nThe game is free; you really don\'t have to pay to play, nor give Snakehead private info, to continue.\n\nI love being part of an awesome Snakehead Games community that loves our games.  \n \n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFor news and updates follow us on social media:\n\nZombie Moon Twitter  https://twitter.com/zombiemoongame\n\nZombie Moon Facebook https://www.facebook.com/ZombieMoonMobile\n\n\nMORE REVIEWS\n\n- FANTASTIC -- This is the very first game I have played on my phone.
